Lexington Community Farm Coalition,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Ecological Well-being,0,10000,"LexFarm is poised to emerge from the initial start-up phase to develop a more robust and sustainable organizational structure. Board members have each served highly active roles and will now hand over operational activities to staff members. Through board retraining and development, we will define committee roles, agree on the types of expertise to be sought from paid staff or volunteers, set priorities, and outline decision-making procedures.

We will design a data snapshot system summarizing progress in finances, farm production, and community engagement, with costs and funding sources allocated to each aspect of the farm and the organization. Such a “dashboard” can also be used to engage the broader community, including future donors.

Finally, LexFarm requires a detailed business plan to guide decision making and resource allocation.

The budget of $10,000 includes funds to compensate Lori Rutter of Adviza Consulting. Ms. Rutter has 20 years' experience consulting with 100 non-profit organizations, including community farms; a strong background in management team development, strategic and business planning, and board governance.

Lexington Arts and Crafts Society,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,6373,"Bringing order into our lives can liberate our creativity and allow us to work productively. Focusing on the large community of artists and crafters in Lexington, the Lexington Arts and Crafts Society (LACS) will offer a series of modular workshops on organizing for the artist or craftsperson.  These modules (several classes/module) will be free to participants. In Module One (2 sessions, max 12 students), student will identify their personal learning and working styles to optimize their ability to learn new skills and maintain new behaviors and be introduced to the processes used to organize and declutter. In Module Two (4 sessions, max 10 students), organizing a craft or artisan studio, decluttering and the decision-making processes, and how to organize and manage paperwork, important files and documents will be taught, because many creative people are 'blocked' by their lack of organization.  Module Three (3 sessions, max 16 students) will focus  on communication skills for families and will teach a family member how to handle a hoarder and how to handle the downsizing and move of a senior family member by learning how to identify issues and communicate without damaging or straining the relationship with the affected family member. Each module includes learning new skills and feedback about using these skills. Participants will be supplied with lists of resources, including recycling and donation information, organizing tools and supplies, and reading matter.  LACS is requesting funding to cover the cost of the instructors, class supplies, overhead, and administrative and publicity costs.",,,,,
Lexington Symphony,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Arts & Culture,5000,10000,"Lexington Symphony (LS), now in its 20th year, is the only established musical organization in Lexington with fully professional (paid) players, and has become one of the only professional orchestras outside Boston that is so actively supported by the community. Its Music Director, Jonathan McPhee, has conducted notable symphony orchestras and ballet companies throughout the world and is also the Music Director of the Boston Ballet. Lexington Symphony’s most recent collaborative project, “Music from the Movies” (MovieMusic), debuted on February 14, 2015 with three components:
• Free performance of Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf for children and families
• Panel discussion/brainstorming session with members of the business community about how to expand MovieMusic to bring additional business to Lexington Center
• Full-length concert featuring music from classic movies, with special guests LHS graduate and film composer Brady Hearn and 12-year-old Lexington resident Hana Chang, violin soloist 

The orchestra would like to expand on this successful event and bring it to more townspeople, using WCRB’s annual Cartoon Festival at Symphony Hall as an instructive model. A committee of Chamber of Commerce members, including members of the banking, pharmaceutical and restaurant industries, has begun the planning stages. MovieMusic would include the following afternoon and evening activities:
• Musical workshop for families, engaging and educating children 
• Art projects
• Performances by LHS students and other local musical groups
• Full-length evening concert by Lexington Symphony featuring classic movie music

MovieMusic will take place at Cary Hall in May 2016 as part of the roster of offerings for the Tourism Committee’s Revolutionary Revelry. Objectives would be to broaden the demographic profile of Lexington Symphony’s audience and to celebrate art and culture in a way that creatively engages universal audiences. ",,,,,
Lexington Friends of the Arts,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Arts & Culture,0,5000,"Munroe Saturday Nights requests funding to support two programming initiatives:  1)The capability to provide minimal support for the artists who present their creative talents at Munroe Saturday NIghts events to provide free performing arts for Lexington,  and 2) funding to provide continuing support for the presentation of arts programs that will reach under-served populations in Lexington.  Through the support of CEL, we hope to be able to build our audiences by developing collaborative arts programming with other civic organizations and with schools in our area. 

RE: item 1: we hope to offer an honorarium of $50 per performer for individuals who take part in our productions.  This minimal amount will underwrite transportation costs and provide a small amount of support to those who devote their time and talent to enriching the cultural life of Lexington.  RE: item 2:  During our current and past seasons we have presented Chinese and East Indian arts and cultural programs, slam poetry/performance art, an evening focused on relationship violence in partnership with other organizations, middle and high school aged youth performing their own production of Shakespeare, among others.  We continue to seek out plays, music, spoken word artists, dancers, and other art forms that will highlight the cultural diversity of Lexington and encourage those who do not traditionally have access to the arts to enjoy our presentations.  In the coming year we have identified an evening of Cuban arts and artists, Native American art cultures, and an evening exploring the intersection of dance and poetry and some of the elements we want to highlight, along with support to continue our work and partnerships with public and private high school students in Lexington and the surrounding communities.  While we have identified the general public as our target, we seek to also reach youth and senior citizens, as well as culturally diverse populations, with our programming.",,,,,
Supportive Living Inc.,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,5000,"The project which we are requesting support for is the physical fitness program currently being operated at our Brain Injury Wellness Center in Lexington.  Since our founding in 1991, Supportive Living has developed four award-winning residential communities for adults recovering from the life-altering consequences of brain injury.  Our largest facility is Douglas House in Lexington on Oakland Street.  In 2012 we opened the Brain Injury Wellness Center at Douglas House to provide physical, cognitive and social rehabilitation programs for survivors. 
The SLI Brain Injury Wellness Center at Douglas House provides physical fitness and exercise programs to address the needs and capabilities of each participant. Certified fitness trainers and intern assistants oversee the programs, which are tailored to each individual’s needs. Our experience has proven a safe and ongoing exercise program plays an important role in the rehabilitation process following a brain injury even years after injury.  Regular physical activity helps improve balance and coordination, reduces reliance on assistive devices, and enhances abilities to perform everyday activities.  Furthermore, following a brain injury, individuals who exercise are typically less depressed and report better quality of life than those who do not.  
Delivery of this program requires funding as the individuals we serve are all low income and do not have the means to pay for these important services.  We have been able to negotiate a reduction in the fees charged by the trainers and have expanded the volunteer effort of the interns to help reduce the overall cost.  The requested funds will be used to cover the cost associated with the specialized trainers that support this program.  ",,,,,
Domestic Violence Services Network,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,7000,10000,"DVSN and the Lexington Police will collaborate to provide four RESIST [Realistic Escape Strategies & Instinct-based Self-defense Training] self defense courses to girls at Lexington High School in the 2015-16 school year.  Each class will consist of two 3-hr. sessions and train 16 participants.  Based on our experience with students at Lincoln-Sudbury HS, we expect the program to be very successful and plan to expand in proceeding years.

Officers will be trained in order to properly staff the classes.  Instructor and coordinator time, student and instructor equipment, and general class supplies (video camera, medical supplies, etc.) will need to be purchased.  

A combination of the traditional self-defense models (like RAD and IMPACT) and police defense tactics training are used as a basis to teach self-defense tactics.  The purpose of the training is to equip the girls with 1) a basic understanding of violence against women, 2) how to improve every day personal safety, 3) learning to value and practice using their voices when attacked, 4) how to physically defend oneself against a violent attack, and 5) an understanding of their own instincts and reactions when under attack and how these can be harnessed.  This succinct, well-designed training provides women with practical, concrete actions they can use regardless of age, size or physical strength.  The purpose is not to stay and fight, but rather to reestablish safety as quickly as possible by creating an opportunity to escape and get help.  

At the end of the training an instructor dons a “Redman” suit (padding and helmet) engaging the students in a number of “attack” simulations in which they are able to put what they have learned into practice.  Simulations are filmed for students to gather and watch the video together collaborating with instructors and each other in assessing their performance.

They learn about dating safety, bystander intervention, resources, and possible next steps in case of an assault.",,,,,
Lexington Tourism Committee,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Arts & Culture,5000,10000,"In 1999, the city of Antony, France, honored its sister city relationship with Lexington by dedicating the Place de Lexington, a landscaped traffic island on a main thoroughfare. In response, the Town of Lexington gave the Lexington Antony Sister Cities (a working group of the Lexington Tourism Committee) permission to create a park in honor of Antony on land within Tower Park. Antony Park was designed by Studio 2112 Landscape Architects to capture the spirit of a formal historical French garden that will be enjoyed by our community as a place to relax, gather, and host small events. This beautiful and unique park will involve the art of landscape design and horticulture with a focal artwork, be a celebration of our French cultural connection from the time of the American Revolution to today, and create a new space where we can come together as a community.

The plan for Antony Park received the approval of the Lexington Selectmen and the Historic Districts Commission in January, 2013. The project is being managed by the Lexington Department of Public Works with the Antony Working Group taking responsibility for raising the necessary funds. By hosting events, grantwriting and direct solicitation, $53,340 has been raised to date from individual Lexingtonians, students who have participated in the Antony exchange program, local foundations, and various groups in Town. These funds have been spent to cover the cost of design, grading of the site, and the planting of 14 columnar trees. In the spirit of a private-public partnership, Seasons Four has donated all the plant materials and provided the trees at cost.

Funding from the Community Foundation of Lexington would help us with the hardscape phase of the project which includes a grand staircase, the retaining seat wall and other stonework.",,,,,
"Cooperative for Human Services, Inc.",2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Community Building,0,10000,"Cooperative for Human Services, Inc. (CHS) provides residential, individual support and guardianship services to 300 adult men and women aged 22 to 87 years with intellectual and developmental disabilities in eastern MA communities.  Our main office is located in Lexington, MA where most of our services originate.   

One of CHS's group residences, located at 45 Forest Street in the historic section of Lexington is a Section 8 subsided home owned by the Lexington Housing Authority.  CHS has worked with the Lexington Housing Authority since the 1980's providing community based, residential support services to 8 men and women who live here and actively participate in the community life of Lexington.  

Due to aging, many of these men and women at Forest Street have developed medical and mobility issues in addition to their intellectual and developmental disabilities.  CHS would like to provide these individuals with an additional comfortable, accessible and safe haven for rest, relaxation and social visits.  We are asking for funds so we can renovate the existing 3 season porch at the Forest St. residence, making it into a year-round and 4 season room that is handicap accessible.  

Although the Forest Street residence is a large home, there is limited accessible space on the first floor where most social and recreational time is spent.  The first floor of this home currently has approximately 800 sq. feet of handicap accessible space, including a large kitchen and dining room and a moderate sized living room.  The 3 season porch is located directly off the current dining room/kitchen area.   

This is a very cost effective proposal.  We anticipate that this project will cost less than 1/3rd of the cost of constructing a first floor addition to the home.  It also would allow the current residents to have access to additional, accessible space for relaxation and visits, especially necessary for aging adults who want to 'age in place in their Lexington home.",,,,,
"Toward Independent Living and Learning, Inc.",2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Community Building,0,4515,"Toward Independent Living and Learning (TILL) created our Living Legacy Project to preserve and share the histories of families supported by TILL, documenting their past so as to shape not just our understanding of the person, but the future of human services through an innovative curriculum and training.  TILL’s Living Legacy Project was developed with the expertise and talents of Nicki Pombier-Berger, a writer and oral historian, to produce these life histories in video format with sensitivity and respect, with a focused curriculum and discussion guide.  TILL Living Legacy Project has been presented to Human Service Professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise, as a training tool for staff to better understand the richness of the experiences and lives of the individuals with whom they work and live and to catch a glimpse of their past.  
As a direct response to the impact this project has had on our staff members, individuals and families, we propose to offer the tools and training to our residential teams to recognize the value of preserving their stories and inspire them to create their own Living Legacy.
Utilizing funds from this community grant, we seek to offer this unique opportunity to those people who live in our three residential homes in Lexington through an individualized workshop training with a professional oral historian, basic equipment to record, preserve and produce oral histories, and follow up training and support from production through to their completion. 
The local impact of this project includes the individuals and families served and the staff who provide support, but also the larger community of TILL and the disability services community who will derive value from these life histories.  We welcome the opportunity to present the project concept, development and outcomes to Lexington community members as appropriate.",,,,,
"Special Needs Arts Programs, Inc",2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Arts & Culture,6000,10000,"Special Needs Arts Programs, Inc. (SNAP), a 501 c 3 nonprofit organization located in Lexington, MA, seeks a $10,000 grant from the Community Endowment of Lexington to support an expansion of our Special Artists program. SNAP’s mission is to provide people with disabilities opportunities that celebrate each person's unique abilities while cultivating creative expression, building peer relationships, and fostering self-esteem through life-enhancing activities in the arts.  This program aligns with two of the Community Endowment’s goals: it “help(s) underserved populations fully participate in community life” and it “reach(es) out and include(s) those who have limited access to arts and culture”.  

Special Artists presently serves 10 intellectually disabled adults for two six-week sessions/year and has a waiting list.  SNAP proposes to double the size of the program with this grant, allowing 10 more people to participate. The grant money would cover the teacher’s salary, supplies for the class and a portion of the Executive Director’s salary required to coordinate the program.  It would also subsidize the program fee for the participants.
 
SNAP is at a critical point in its history as it transitions from a founder-led organization to management by paid administrative staff and the next generation of board members.  Up until October 2014, Marilyn Abel and Judith Goldner, the founders of SNAP, led the organization and the board of directors did much of the behind-the-scenes work in administering and running it.  The board voted in October to hire SNAP’s first paid Executive Director in order to sustain Ms. Abel and Ms. Goldner's vision and allow SNAP to move forward.  Funding from the Community Endowment will allow SNAP to begin to expand our programming in a financially responsible fashion and to bridge our revenue goals as we ramp up our fundraising.",,,,,

Communities for Restorative Justice,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Community Building,7000,10000,"Communities for Restorative Justice (C4RJ) is a community–police partnership that has twelve (12) partner police departments who identify cases that can be resolved through restorative justice rather than proceeding with criminal charges. Lexington Police Department (LPD) joined C4RJ in 2014 and our goal for this proposal is to increase awareness of restorative justice in Lexington.  This will in turn result in more involvement of Lexington residents as C4RJ volunteers as well as higher case referrals from the LPD. As a community–police partnership that responds to crimes by bringing the impacted parties together to discuss the harm, we are an innovative collaboration that meets the Community Endowment of Lexington’s (CEL) goals for Lexington citizens by making life healthier, more enjoyable, and safer.

Program- Restorative justice focuses on bringing parties together after a harm to discuss who was impacted, whose responsibility it is to repair the damage, and how we can make things as right as possible. Most case referrals involve a young offender. In 2014, 83% of our referrals were under 21. Our process gives voice to those affected by wrongdoing while providing support to the victim, community, and the offender. We use a strengths-based approach to provide offenders the opportunity to learn about the effects of their decisions.  Our program helps them emerge with dignity and improved decision-making skills.  

Project- C4RJ will use an award from the Community Endowment of Lexington for general operating funds.  We aim to increase our presence and gain stakeholders in Lexington. C4RJ staff will train police officers and also raise awareness in the community by hosting events to build awareness. These outreach programs are essential to recruit volunteers and board members, to educate residents, and to develop our donor network. This process is the key to maintaining a sustainable model with a reliable flow of case referrals and funding.",,,,,
Greater Boston PFLAG,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,5000,"We would like to bring our Safe Schools and Communities (SSC) Program to the Town of Lexington.  

Our award-winning SSC Program typically involves sending in trained facilitators along with speakers, to create a safe environment where people can learn through other's personal stories/experiences, where questions can be asked and answered, and where attendees leave feeling more prepared to support LGBTQ individuals and in order to create safer environments. Support and education for parents, educators, service providers and others in the community is the vital link to LGBTQ youth that needs to be addressed.

A $5,000 grant would allow us to offer 4 extended programs to the Town of Lexington.  We propose offering a full-day of workshops for the high school (FYI: we offered 180 trainings in MA high schools last year alone), a full-day of in-service trainings for school district faculty and/of staff, and two different community events for parents/families.  As mentioned below (in ""Nature of Collaboration"" section), the goal of these programs is for participants to learn how to create environments that are LGBTQ-welcoming and inclusive, how to be supportive of LGBTQ people, how to stand up as an ally, how to prevent bullying, and to become aware of the various types of ongoing support offered by Greater Boston PFLAG, should people want to participate in support groups, as volunteer speakers/educators, etc.

We would work with the various town leaders, in the school system, community center, etc., to come up with the best programs that would meet the needs of the various audiences we would be meeting with.",,,,,
F.U.S.E. Preschool,2015 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,10000,"The FUSE Preschool is a local community based early education setting for children with a variety of special needs.  All children entering our program have both social and emotional challenges.  We specifically need more sensory motor equipment both inside and outside to better serve these children.  The diagnosis might vary from Autism, ADHD, anxiety, or sensory integration disorder but their primary need for sensory regulation permeates all diagnosis as the catalyst for positive social engagement.  We have a highly trained occupational therapist who is specially trained in sensory integration and she has specific recommendations that would enhance our program. 

The equipment purchased from this grant would also be used by our after school program which serves children through the fifth grade and our summer camp which serves children through the third grade.  

We hold monthly professional trainings to educate local professionals on how to better serve special needs children so we would then be able to incorporate a training series on sensory integration methods and models for children during the school day. ",,,,,
Town of Lexington,2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Community Building,0,10000,"The requested grant is intended to provide seed funds to enable the renewal of a professionally conducted effort to gather and process community-wide information on citizen values, needs and effective demands with regard to Lexington’s future.    The goal is to prepare the renewal of the town-wide survey taking into account demographic changes in the community and establishing the structure for subsequent longitudinal studies.  A successful project would lead to a request to the Town Manager/Board of Selectmen for a Town-funded project to conduct the survey and study the following year.

Since its formal creation in 2000 the Lexington 20/20 Vision Committee has periodically conducted town-wide meetings and formal surveys that have generated both quantitative and qualitative data to help guide its initiatives relating to Lexington’s long-term future.     Building upon its most recent survey of 2013, the 20/20 Vision Committee is preparing to renew its broad-based citizen input to allow for longtime residents and newly arrived population groups in town to express their concerns regarding housing, economic and social diversity, education, open space, civic discourse and other matters affecting community-building and engagement.

"Advocates, Inc.",2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,2028," We are requesting support for the Adaptive Cycling for Recreation (ACR) Project with the goal of increasing our capacity for improving physical fitness and promoting wellness through adapted cycling activities based out of our 7 Oakland Street, Lexington, MA site. The ACR primarily serves adult survivors of brain injury and other neurologic diagnoses (i.e. Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis) who are challenged with residual cognitive, physical, emotional and/or sensory symptoms. During the 2015 cycling season (June-November) the ACR supported 17 individuals (combination of individuals from Advocates Brain Injury Residential and Day & Community Services) in riding a total of 117.25 miles, 29 hours and 35 minutes on the Minuteman Bike Path. These outcomes were improved from the 2014 riding season thanks to the funds we received through grants to secure additional cycling equipment (including a grant from CEL). We now have two tandem recumbent cycles available for use which require participants to ride with a staff person or friend. Over the 2015 season several of the participants progressed to being able to independently power, steer, and brake which is why we want to expand our cycle fleet to include a cycle that will enable individuals to enjoy cycling in the least restrictive manner possible.  If funded by CEL, we will purchase one recumbent trike and adaptive accessories necessary for that cycle. An additional benefit of securing a single trike is that we will likely be able to store and use it year-round for indoor conditioning over the winter and during inclement weather using the indoor stationary trainers that we have. This is not possible with the tandems due to limited space. The ARC will continue to facilitate education and advocacy opportunities so that others living in and visiting Lexington can gain access to adaptive cycling opportunities.",,,,,
In Control Family Foundation,2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,10000,"Auto Crashes are by far the #1 killer of teens.  Our training drastically reduces new driver crash rates and we would like to see a larger percentage of Lexington teens participate in our course.  While we understand that many residents can afford to sign up on their own, subsidies from partners/grantors have been found to significantly improve demand from subsidized towns which often leads to a long term spike in enrollment in that community.

We would like to see $10,000 used to subsidize 50 students from Lexington where they would be asked to pay $50 towards the training and the balance of their training costs would be covered by the grant.  In Control would approach the high school and the police department and other community organizations to help promote this program.  We would handle registration and encourage parents to accompany their teens to training in hopes of influencing their driving habits (and encouraging them to model the right behavior).  A list of those 16-25 year old participants (or younger depending on how you define youth) would be maintained via a unique reporting link so that you could identify and follow up with any/all to confirm attendance and hear feedback on the program.",,,,,

We plan to have up to six speakers to present on energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture and healthy food, health consequences of climate change, renewable energy, green schools, transportation, water and other environmental topics.  In addition, we will invite area vendors and provide information tables. To accomplish this we would pay an experienced individual to: coordinate the event which would include: renting space, paying fees or honorariums for speakers, prepare and distribute publicity, and contact and schedule area vendors and environmental groups. 
We propose using space in Lexington High School commons to accommodate table presentations from appropriate organizations and rent the auditorium and /or larger lecture halls for speakers and films to be presented throughout the day; 
Lexington Global Warming Action Coalition has had experience in running two very successful Energy Fairs in the past. This Sustainability Fair will be wider in scope.

Lexington Council for the Arts,2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Arts & Culture,0,5000,"As the Council for the Arts is charged with furthering the appreciation and support of the arts in Lexington, it would do well to let everyone know what is happening.   A lot is happening in Lexington, but if one is ""not in the stream"" they often don't know about it.  Much has been done by the Council to build mechanisms for helping residents know about the arts in town, but more is needed to both inform residents on a global level, and to create on-going information dissemination.  

In the past year, the Council has established a website as a resource where residents can find out about current events and local resources, and established an eMail group for local artists.  In the past two years, the Council has over quadrupled awareness throught its social media outlets. The Council is currently in the planning stages of creating a digital newsletter to be able to send out detailed arts-related information on a semi-annual basis. 

The Council is looking for funds to create a town-wide mailing to both share information about these resources, and to invite residents to donate to a Council fund that would kickstart other community initiatives such as public art  and programming.

"Special Needs Arts Programs, Inc",2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,10000,"SNAP will pilot an Expressive Arts curriculum within our Special Artists program.  Our participants have autism, down syndrome, and other cognitive and developmental delays.  By combining two and three dimensional art techniques, participants will express their emotions on a given social theme while focusing on the process of creating.  Social themes can include special events, life milestones, and interactions with peers.
Individuals with developmental disabilities often struggle with expressing their feelings in socially appropriate ways.  Expressive Arts will create a more introspective experience for our participants, using art as the medium to better identify and communicate their emotions.  The projects will involve channeling their innermost thoughts and feelings and representing those in a tangible way.  
Prior to each project, participants will be guided through a discussion about the emotions they want to represent.  For example, matching emotions with shapes, colors, and textures.  Participants will then be guided through the process of creating their projects by choosing between several different art materials.  Participants will be able to use different art materials to represent their emotions within the social theme of that class.  The teacher will encourage the participants to talk about and share their projects with peers and to reflect on their feelings while in the creative process.
Art and the creative process can help these individuals to engage in all of the senses and various techniques and aspects that art has to offer, which is valuable for reducing stress and achieving personal insight.  Multi-sensory learning of art will stimulate their curiosity and our introspective approach will help them to better identify and communicate their emotions.

Lexington Fire Department,2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Environment,0,2500,"This is an opportunity for Lexington to reinvigorate the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Since 1986, it has been an unfunded Federal mandate for cities and towns nationwide to become more familiar with businesses that store, manage or transport hazardous materials. With this proposal, Lexington will be able to hire a Hazardous Materials Consultant who will be able to review existing protocols and update these protocols for any current trends in the industry. Recent concerns from a town organization called Sustainable Lexington have alerted us to potential concerns of heightened storm activity due to climate change. Hazardous materials that are exposed to surface waters may cause pollution concerns. In addition, a recent report by Todd Dresser of Louriero Associates performed a study of LEPC's and found only a small percentage were fully active. One of the reasons of low level of utilization of the LEPC authority is a lack of funding assistance. Although Lexington's LEPC is ahead of many other communities is ahead of other communities in terms of support for LEPC, there is much more that can be done. Any additional investment is one that pays for itself in enhanced safety and avoids costly environmental clean up, work stoppage, and community disruption. As the frequency of storm events increases, the value of avoiding these problems increases. 
Since Lexington has not had a significant threat or release of Hazardous Material it is often difficult to request additional funding during our annual budget process. That is why this grant proposal to enhance our capabilities is such an important potential program improvement.   ",,,,,
Communities for Restorative Justice,2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Community Building,0,10000,"Communities for Restorative Justice (C4RJ) respectfully requests $10,000 in general funding for our core mission: to provide a healing, inclusive, and cost-effective complement to the criminal justice system whereby victims of crime are given the opportunity to address the person(s) who have harmed them, offenders are held accountable for their actions, and the community provides support. 

C4RJ is a community–police partnership with 15 partner police departments that can refer juvenile or adult cases for resolution through a restorative justice process rather than through the criminal justice system. C4RJ works with the parties affected by crime: victims, offenders, and community members. In a safe setting, victim(s) of a crime address those who have harmed them and explore how the harm may be repaired. Offenders come to understand the impact of their actions, to be accountable for them, and to make amends. Participating community members experience the healing effect of relationships restored after crime. 

C4RJ’s success—measured by rates of offender recidivism and satisfaction among all parties—has generated demand for its services. C4RJ also now works with the Middlesex District Attorney’s Juvenile Diversion Program and is a resource for cases, countywide, involving first-time offenders under 18 who have committed a misdemeanor or low-level felony.

In Lexington, we will build on last year's project. We will continue training efforts with the Lexington Police Department.  We will work with LexMedia to show C4RJ's film, ""Finding Courage,"" introduced by Chief Corr.  We will hold an outreach event to raise awareness. This may be like the event on March 22, 2016 with Representatives Kaufman and Garballey, or a table at the Lexington farmer's market, or a presentation to the Lexington Rotary.  We will continue to recruit volunteers, board members, community liaisons, and donors from Lexington.",,,,,
"Town of Lexington, Office of Public Health",2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,7500,7500,"Whether it’s hiking on Lexington Conservation trails or just working in your yard, you are at risk for contracting Lyme disease. The Lexington Board of Health and Public Health Office want to educate its citizens of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease and what you can do to prevent it.  Annual confirmed cases of Lyme disease in Lexington average in the low teens and have remained constant over the last few years. Unconfirmed cases are much higher.
 
Lyme disease is a potentially debilitating bacterial infection spread through the bite of an infected deer tick (Ixodes scapularis).  Most humans are infected through the bite of immature deer ticks called nymphs.  Deer ticks wait in the tall grass or bushes for a mammal to pass by so that they may hitch a ride and at the same time, have a nourishing blood meal.  While extracting blood from the human host, a bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi) from the tick’s internal systems is transferred. Both nymph (baby) and adult deer ticks can spread the disease, and often go unnoticed because of their small size (no larger than a sesame seed).  First recognized in the mid 1970’s it was named after an unusual outbreak of arthritis near the Town of Lyme, Connecticut. Lyme disease has become well established in this region mostly due to the number of deer populations.

Two thirds of the funds would be used to conduct a one time Research study of public lands in Lexington to determine the Risk Factor for an individual to contract Lyme Disease.  Ticks will be collected in early summer through late Fall.  These ticks will be tested to find out if they carry Lyme Disease.   The Research study will identify habitats in Lexington and they will be mapped, using GPS technology.  As a result of the data collection, an action plan will be developed.  The remaining 1/3 of the funds would be used for public education efforts and to inform the public about the results of the Research  and to promote Tick bite prevention.",,,,,
Domestic Violence Services Network,2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,10000,"With DVSN working closely with the Lexington Police Department, the Concord District Court, Emerson Hospital, and 85 volunteer community advocates, this grant would help SUPPORT THEIR COORDINATED COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.  

To benefit Lexington residents living with domestic abuse, we would: 
1. Recruit, train, and supervise 15-18 new volunteer Advocates for its police, court and Emerson Hospital programs.
2. Closely supervise and continue to train/enhance the skills and knowledge of veteran volunteer Advocates .
3. Include two to four Lexington officers and/or dispatchers in our each of two 40-hour advocate training programs.
4. Provide 24 workshops for veteran volunteer advocates to hone their skills and brush up on complex aspects of the job. 
5. Update the expanded database of resources available to our clients and our advocates on our website with a specific focus on resources more appropriate and more convenient to:
• Clients in Lexington and surrounding towns
• Clients from the South Asian, and East Asian cultures
• Clients with children/adolescents who witness domestic violence
?      Clients who are disabled or elderly
6.  Work closely with the Lexington police department by following up on all domestic incidents in order to provide an effective coordinated community response to stop domestic violence.
7.  Design a program for the annual 2017 Clergy Symposium that will help local clergy develop tools and protocols for combating domestic violence within their congregations.

DVSN services any victim of domestic violence who lives, works, or is assaulted in Lexington. Based on recent history, DVSN expects to receive over 100 referrals from Lexington police, Concord court, and Emerson including requests for service from Lexington residents who are victims of domestic violence calling our Help Line.  DVSN is the only provider of outreach and support services to Lexington residents who are victims of domestic violence.",,,,,
Lex Eat Together,2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,3600,10000,"Together (LET) seeks $10,000 from the Community Endowment of Lexington to support our weekly, volunteer-led meal in the heart of downtown Lexington for anyone in need of a nutritious meal or companionship. Since our first dinner in October at the Church of Our Redeemer, we have averaged 35 meals per week.  Our guests include isolated seniors, struggling single parents and their children, people experiencing homelessness, veterans with mental health issues, and those who struggle with physical health issues.   

Since our first meal in October 2015, Lex Eat Together has served approximately 700 meals to guests, averaging about 35 per weekly meal.  Forecasting at this rate would yield roughly 1750 meals served to individuals in need in Lexington.

While our mission is focused on the guests who attend our dinners, our program affects the volunteers who cook and serve the meals, interact with guests, as well as set up and clean up the hall.  We have over 150 people who serve as our volunteer base to staff our meals, from high school youth to seniors, and these volunteers are impacted and changed through the opportunity to serve and the community that has emerged from our meals.",,,,,

Dependence on board members is necessary at startup but not sustainable moving forward.

We will build leadership capacity through executive committee coaching (""train the trainers""), board retraining, and board development. We will define committee roles, agree on the expertise needed from paid staff or volunteers, set priorities, and outline decision-making procedures.

We will design an information “dashboard” to monitor and summarize progress towards goals in finances, farm production, and community programs. Such reports can be used to trigger decisions, e.g., ""We will hire an administrative assistant (or Executive Director) when income is reliably at x dollars,"" or to engage external partners and donors.

Finally, we will develop a detailed business plan to guide decision-making and resource allocation.

The budget includes funds to hire Lori Rutter of Adviza Consulting (www.adviza.com). Ms. Rutter has helped us progress this year through pro bono advice. Over 20 years she has consulted with 100 non-profit organizations, including community farms; she has a strong background in business planning and board governance.

PROPOSED WORK

A. DEVELOP AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE ($5,000, 3 months) 
A1. Provide board training and review board skills matrix
A2. Delineate board and staff roles and responsibilities
A3. Structure board and committee relationships
A4. Develop board goals and accountabilities

B. ANALYTICS DASHBOARD ($2,000, 3 months)

"Lexington's Five and Under Network PTA, Inc.",2016 Community Endowment of Lexington Grant Program,Health & Human Services,0,3400,"LexFUN! plans to use the requested funds to bring one of the most powerful films about what’s possible in American education to our town of Lexington – “Beyond Measure: Rescuing an Overscheduled, Overtested, Underestimated Generation.”  
From kindergarteners to high-schoolers, thousands of Lexington students are being pressured to achieve high grades, to achieve high test scores, to pursue more AP courses than classmates and to seek out admission to one of the nation’s elite colleges.  Our children are being pressured to overachieve, to fiercely compete against classmates, to go without sleep and to sacrifice the quality of their young lives to pursue these.  The 2010 documentary, “Race to Nowhere”, demonstrated how the pursuit of such a narrow form of “success” (high grades, overachieving, etc.) is irreparably harming the physical and mental health of our children.  Data from our own Lexington Youth Risk Behavior Surveys confirmed this not once (in 2013), but twice (again in 2015). 
This data is chilling, especially the data about suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts. LexFUN! does not want our toddlers and preschoolers to enter our school system and turn into these statistics.  LexFUN! wants to challenge our community to think differently about what it means to achieve “educational success”.  The film, Beyond Measure, will help us do precisely that.  The film asks new, thought-provoking questions about what it means to achieve “educational success.”
The requested funds will cover the cost for the film license, a local venue to show the film (perhaps at the high school, perhaps elsewhere; potentially two showings to meet expected demand), advertising and promotion (sandwich board signs, flyers, an invitation to every teacher, administrator, and School Board Member in Lexington, etc.), and light refreshments.",,,,,
